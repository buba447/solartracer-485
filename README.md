Tools for Connecting Tracer BN Solar Charger to Raspberry Pi with Python via rs485
===================================================

This is the second generation of the EPsolar Tracer solar charge controller. 
You need RS-485 adapter for communication. The first generation controller 
used RS-232 and a different protocol. see https://github.com/xxv/tracer.

This repo is a fork of [epsolar-tracer](https://github.com/kasbert/epsolar-tracer/)
The epsolar-tracer repo had a few bugs and an outdated linux driver that didnt work with the Raspberry Pi 3.

Linux driver for Exar USB UART
------------------------------
Heres how to install the driver for a usb to rs-485 similar to the one [found here]()
The [xr_usb_serial_common](https://github.com/buba447/solartracer-485/xr_usb_serial_common_lnx-3.6-and-newer-pak/) directory contains the makefile and instructions that will compile properly on Rasbian OS on a raspberry pi 3. Before compiling be sure to install the linux headers with 
`sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers`

After installing the headers be sure to `sudo bundle` then `sudo make`.
The resulting `xr_usb_serial_common.ko` file will need to be moved to `/lib/modules/YOUR_LINUX_VERSION/extra/`.
After building and moving the module, remove the cdc-acm driver that automatically installs for the usb-485 adapter.

`rmmod cdc-acm`
`modprobe -r usbserial`
`modprobe usbserial`

You will also need to add the cdc-acm to the system blacklist:

`echo blacklist cdc-acm > /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cdc-acm.conf`
Note: If echo doesnt work you will need to add `blacklist cdc-acm` manually to the blacklist with vim `vi /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cdc-acm.conf`

Finally add `xr_usb_serial_common` to '/etc/modules' to autoload the module on startup.

After all of this is done make sure that the new driver loads correctly by reloading the linux dependency list `depmod -ae`
Then load the module with `modprobe xr_usb_serial_common`

If all goes well you should see `ttyXRUSB` when listing `ls /dev/tty*`

Reboot and enjoy!

Protocol
--------
[Protocol](http://www.solar-elektro.cz/data/dokumenty/1733_modbus_protocol.pdf)
See for [windows capture](archive/epsolar.txt) for some extra commands.

Python module
-------------
Uses modbus library (https://github.com/bashwork/pymodbus)  
Example output
```
# python info.py
